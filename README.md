# Advent of Code 2019

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2019 problems, implemented in Python3. It is also my first real attempt at working with Python for something beyond simple scripts, so in the spirit of the holidays, please be forgiving :santa:

For more information Advent of Code, check out the [site](https://adventofcode.com/2019), it's pretty cool.

## Run Run Rudolph

To compute the solution to an Advent of Code problem, run the main script from the project's root directory:

```
$ python3 -m aoc2019 1-1
```

The argument `1-1` represents the day and the part(1 or 2) of the problem. For example, to get the answer for part two of day 4's problem, then the argument would be `4-2`.

## God Test Ye Merry Gentlemen

To run the tests, simply run this command from the project's root directory:

```
$ python3 -m unittest
```
